👥 Hi Teams! 👥

🇦🇺 This is Team 11429 based in Sydney, Australia. 🇦🇺

⤷ 🎉 We've competed in numerous FIRST competitions, including FLL, FTC as well as FGC, where we represented Australia in 2025 at Panama City. 🎉

⤷ </> This is our first year competing in FRC, and this GitHub page helps us to document our footprint, as well as help rookies in the near future. </>

⚒️ We are competing in FRC 2026 REBUILT. ⚒️

🏆 On this GitHub page, we will be sharing some basic code first, and eventually, our whole code, nearing the competition date. 🏆

🍀 We wish all teams the best of luck this season. We hope to see all of you in person! 🍀 <br>

🌱 Hi Rookie Teams! 🌱

👋 First of all, Team 11429 would like to welcome you. 👋

😕 We know it's hard and almost always frustrating. If you ever get stuck, or don't know where to start, please contact us: **team11429@newai.com.au** 😕

🤔 If you have any questions about our code, or if there's a bug, feel free to reach out to us via our email above. 🤔

💬 We love seeing feedback, so if our code works for you, please tell us! 💬

📚 One of the lessons we've learnt through our journey through robotics, is this: celebrate from your successes and learn from your losses. 📚

📝 It's the main reason we've started this GitHub page: to document our losses and our successes. 📝

✍️ If something worked or didn't work as expected, write it down, and share it with judges, volunteers and other teams. ✍️

💭 Your thought process is way more important than the result. 💭

🎯 Don't forget, you can always ask more experienced teams for help. 🎯

🙌 Whether we see your team at a competition, we are always rooting for you. 🙌

💪 Being a rookie is tough, but you are tougher! 💪
